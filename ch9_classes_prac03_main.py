# This program builds upon the last practice project.
# We will create a login system for a fake web message board.
# It will not be secure (but we are just practicing with classes).
# It will not write to any files -- that's next chapter!

# We will first import one of our modules.
import ch9_classes_prac03_module3 as mod3

# Then call a function to get the ball rolling...
# (See module3 comments)
